# Cinema Audience Forecasting challenge

Project: Cinema Audience Forecasting challenge — exploratory analysis and baseline forecasting models for predicting audience counts.

Files in this repository
- `23f2001305-notebook-t32025 - ML.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook with EDA, feature engineering and modeling.
- `requirements.txt` — Python package requirements to run the notebook.
- `.gitignore` — recommended ignores (virtualenvs, checkpoint files).

Quickstart (open the notebook locally)
1. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Start Jupyter Lab or Notebook and open the file:

```bash
jupyter lab
# or
jupyter notebook
```

Why the notebook might look non-editable
- GitHub displays notebooks as static rendered files (read-only). To edit cells, open the notebook in a local Jupyter server (see Quickstart above) or use an online environment that supports notebooks (Binder, Colab, or GitHub Codespaces).

Optional: Open in Binder
- Add a `binder` badge or create a `binder` configuration to run the notebook in the cloud without local setup.

Notes & next steps
- If you want, I can: add a LICENSE, convert the notebook to a clean `.py` script, create a Binder/Colab link, or extract runnable scripts from the notebook.

License
- Add a license file (e.g., `MIT`) if you want this project publicly reusable.
